Project MyGov is one of five initiatives that are part of the White House Presidential Innovation Fellows program. This new program is bringing in top innovators from outside government to work with top innovators inside government to create real and substantial changes that will in a very short time frame benefit the American people, save taxpayers money, and help create new jobs.

The purpose of Project MyGov is to reimagine how citizens interact with government through an experience designed around their needs rather than a confusing and fragmented bureaucracy. 

At its core, MyGov is aimed at better serving the common needs of all Americans, but we are also creating a platform that makes it easy for our our partners in agencies across government to do that in their own way. On the citizen side there’s a lot of redundancy and duplication of effort when filling out forms or looking for answers to common questions. There’s also a lot of duplication of effort by agencies around these services, and a high barrier to entry to implement user management and persistency for personalized services. 

In order to address these issues, MyGov aims to establish a platform that provides trusted authentication and personalized services as well as a more simplified and unified experience for interactions with government in general. It will also include a toolkit for agencies to leverage the power of the platform, utilizing this new MyGov login service’s personalization and unified experience.
